## Why

Imagine yourself as a software developer in company.
You're working in a team of 5 people.
Everyone needs to make changes to files

To avoid disaster, we need a way of:
- Tracking the version of the files
- Distribute the files to each member
- Using changes from other peoples

## What
> Git

Git is a version control system. There are many version control systems, but `git` is a very popular one.

> Version Control System

It's a system that allows you to record edits to files over time. Hence the name.
Version control systems allow groups of people to edit the same files and have a clean way of controlling the version and order of changes.
